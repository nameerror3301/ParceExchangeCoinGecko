# ParceCoinGeckoExchange

## This script is a commercial product. 

    It simply collects all the exchanges from the site CoinGecko.

    Perhaps you could think of doing everything together, parsing coins and parsing exchanges?

    1 - At the request of the client it was made by a separate program.

    2 - Number of requests per minute on the site 50. Given that you have a free subscription.

    3 - I publish my projects as they are. And how they were commissioned ))
